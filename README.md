# WNS-Analytics-Wizard
This was a competition held by WNS on Analytics Vidhya website.  I ranked 137th out of 6456 competitors. I have uploaded the photo of the final leaderboard. 
 
 The task was to predict whether a user will click on the 'Advertisement' hosted on some webiste by another website. For eg, if you are surfing through your Facebook feed and you see an advertisement of Amazon sales, then the task was to predict the probability that you will click on the advertisement. In one of the datasets, following information was given : impression-time (time at which advertisement was shown), user_id, app_code, is_4G, os_version and target (is_click) labelled. Another dataset had information about : session_id (id of the session when the user logged into suppose Amazon website), device_type, item_id. Another dataset had info about item like item_type, item_price. First dataset had 1 month timeline info, the second dataset had session_ids of past two months including the month of the first dataset timeline. We had to predict for 1 week data.
